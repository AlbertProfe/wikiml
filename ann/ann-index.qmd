# Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

## Overview

> **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** are computational models inspired by biological neural networks in human brains. They are designed to process complex data and perform tasks like classification, prediction, and pattern recognition.

## Architecture

Layers:

- **Input Layer**: Initial point of data entry
- **Hidden Layers**: Process and analyze data
- **Output Layer**: Provides final computational results

## Types of Neural Networks

**Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**

- Data moves in one direction
- No cycles or loops
- Straightforward processing

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

- Specialized for processing grid data (images)
- Uses convolutional layers
- Effective for image recognition

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**

- Designed for sequence prediction
- Maintains context across inputs
- Useful for time-series and language processing

## Training Methods

Learning Approaches:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovers patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns through environmental interaction

Training Process:

- Forward Propagation
- Loss Function Calculation
- Backward Propagation (Backpropagation)

## Applications

Key Areas:

- Natural Language Processing
- Healthcare
- eCommerce
- Computer Vision

## Challenges

Limitations:

- Overfitting
- Lack of Interpretability
- High Training Data Requirements
- Computational Intensity

Ethical Considerations:

- Bias in decision-making
- Accountability
- Transparency in automated systems
