# Introduction

**Machine learning (ML)** is a branch of *artificial intelligence (AI)* focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data.

[UC Berkeley](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/blog/what-is-machine-learning/){.external target='_blank'} breaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts.

- **A Decision Process**: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.
- **An Error Function**: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.
- **A Model Optimization Process**: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.

> Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.

# Machine Learning fields

The core idea that classifies Deep Learning as a field of Machine Learning (ML) lies in its use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multiple layers to automatically learn patterns and representations from data. Unlike traditional ML, which often requires manual feature engineering, deep learning models extract features hierarchically, enabling them to handle complex tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.

Key fields in Machine Learning:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Semi-Supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning are key paradigms in machine learning. Each approach addresses different types of problems and data availability.

Supervised learning uses labeled data for training, while unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning combines both, and reinforcement learning focuses on decision-making through trial and error in dynamic environments.

# Deep Learning as a Distinct Field

**Core Concept**: Deep learning utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep architectures) to automatically learn representations from data, distinguishing it from traditional machine learning methods that often rely on manual feature extraction.

**Complexity Handling**: Deep learning excels at managing high-dimensional data and capturing non-linear relationships, making it particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition.
